				<div class="article_description">Max Verstappen told his team he was in no mood to drive “like a grandma” when Red Bull asked him to manage his tyres as he hunted down the two Mercedes in the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix. He kept the pressure on – and went on to clinch a sensational win. His boss Christian Horner was suitably impressed with his performance, quipping “his grandma must drive quickly”…After an inspired and brave decision to qualify on the hard compound tyre, allowing him to start the race on that tyre while everyone else in the top 10 was on the mediums</div>

				<div class="article_title">Football</div>
				<div class="article_description"> Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.
